Proteome Annotation Transfer Tool (PATT) is a powerful and versatile software tool for transferring annotations from a reference genome to an unannotated query genome. Developed using the Snakemake workflow management system, PATT provides a streamlined and efficient approach to annotating new genomes, enabling researchers to rapidly and accurately annotate large-scale genomic data sets.

With its intuitive user interface and robust annotation algorithms, PATT is designed to simplify the process of annotating new genomes, making it accessible to both computational and non-computational biologists. Whether you are working with a large-scale transcriptome data set or a single genome assembly, PATT offers a comprehensive solution for annotating new genomes, streamlining your research process and delivering high-quality results.
